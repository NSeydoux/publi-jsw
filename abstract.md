To develop the Semantic Web of Things, the Semantic Web principles and technologies have to be adapted to the constraints of the IoT domain, which is a challenge and requires innovative approaches to applicative-dedicated reasoning.
The Cloud computing paradigm, essential to the deployment of scalable IoT applications, is not suited for low-latency decision making, as opposed to Fog computing, which consider nodes in between IoT devices and Cloud nodes.
In order to support on-demand reasoning, and to avoid a potential single point of failure, we consider a hybrid solution including both Cloud and Fog nodes.
Moreover, IoT networks being open and constituted of potentially mobile nodes,  the computation should be dynamically distributed across Fog nodes according to the evolution of the network topology.
That is why EDR, the contribution presented in this paper, is a generic approach to the dynamic distribution of rule-based reasoning in a Cloud-Fog IoT  architecture.
After having presented the mechanisms enabling the genericity and the dynamicity of EDR, its scalability is evaluated in a simulated smart factory use case.
The complementarity between Fog and Cloud is discussed based on the conducted experimentations.

The successful deployment of the Semantic Web of Things (SWoT) requires the adaptation of the Semantic Web principles and technologies to the constraints of the IoT domain, which is the challenging research direction we address here. 
In this context we promote distributed reasoning approaches in IoT systems by implementing a hybrid deployment of reasoning rules relying on the complementarity of Cloud and Fog computing.  
Our solution benefits from the remote powerful Cloud computation resources, essential to the deployment of scalable IoT applications while avoiding low-latency decision making by including the local distributed constrained Fog computation resources, close to data producers.
Moreover, IoT networks being open and constituted of potentially mobile nodes, the computation should be dynamically distributed across Fog nodes according to the evolution of the network topology.
For this purpose, we propose the Emergent Distributed Reasoning (EDR) approach, implementing a dynamic distributed deployment of reasoning rules in a Cloud-Fog IoT architecture.
We elaborated mechanisms enabling the genericity and the dynamicity of EDR.
We evaluated its scalability and applicability in a simulated smart factory use-case.
The complementarity between Fog and Cloud in this context is assessed based on the conducted experimentations.
