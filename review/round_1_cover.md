- Addressed issues :
  - Core issues
    - Dynamicity : The proposed approach is meant to by dynamic by design, since the core algorithm is event-driven and updates the distribution of rules continuously. This aspect is now stated more clearly, as well as the fact that unexpected failure of nodes is currently not dealt with (it is part of our hypothesis in Section 4.1). It is also true that this aspect is not featured in the evaluation section (which is now presented as future work), and therefore it has been removed from the title. However, since the continuous adaptability is a property that shapes the proposed algorithm, dynamicity is still listed among the motivations.
    - The fact that how nodes use deductions triggered by rules to take actions is not part of the proposed contribution is now stated more clearly in Section 4.2.
    - Unfeasability of deployment : We did not mean to say that such a deployment would be unfeasible, but rather that we currently do not have the ressources (in terms of hardware), to implement it without simulating part of it. The formulation has been rephrased to clarify this intent. The suggestion of the reviewer is however very interesting, and I will consider pursuing future work to compare our approach (dissemination of queries) to the DLUBM's (centralized querying of distributed endpoints).
    - The format of data exchanged has been presented in Section 6.3. It is featured in the description of the use case, because it is not part of the core contribution, which aims at being generic enough to support various vocabularies as long as they are described with the appropriate properties of the edr ontology.
    - Volumes of data are more clearly represented, with the duration of simlations associated to the data generation rate.
    - In a network that is not hierarchical, the proposed approach would not be applicable. In the particular case of an acyclic graph, a cover tree may be built to overcome the problem, leading to a deployment on a "virtual tree". The main issue with non-tree network is the potential redundancy of the deployment, as illustrated in the attached figure. The same rule would be deployed in two different nodes, to be applied on the same data. The mechanism preventing the re-evaluation of a rule based on the same observations would work, but there would be extra network traffic. A sentence has been added to Section 4.1 to emphasise this.
    - Applicability for complex node descriptions
        - It is a good point, and this remark applies to some extent to observations as well, which general template is hard-coded so far (even if the use of a standard vocabulary mitigates the issue with such a lack of flexibility). A solution to adress this issue would be to consider embedding construct queries in the node's KB instead of marking properties that should be annouced. Therefore, nodes could forge queries describing precisely what they need to know about they neighbours, depending on the policy they implement. The same goes for the exchanged data, with nodes able to describe the information they want to be forwarded about the target's KB in order to make a decision. These considerations are significant contributions, and would require a publication on their own, that I will consider for future work. I however think that discussing this in the future work section of the present paper would extend its already broad focus, and would bring confusion, that is why it is not mentionned.
    - Formalization
    - Complexity of exchanged rules : The present contribution only considers rule-based reasoning, with any rule being expressed as a SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries. Considering more complex structures would lead to address more general distributed computing issues, which would be of interest, but out of the scope of the current contribution.  
  - Secondary issues
    - Bibliographic errors have been fixed
    - Linked Open Rules have been changed into Linked Rules
    - The paper has been proof-read for typos
    - Namespaces are now listed in appendix
